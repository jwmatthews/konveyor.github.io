After months of ideas, development, and feedback from early users and contributors, we're excited to share the first official release of **[Konveyor AI 0.1.0](https://github.com/konveyor/editor-extensions/releases/tag/v0.1.0)**.

This release is a significant step forward for the Konveyor project, and for anyone working through the complex journey of application modernization. It marks the beginning of **developer-focused, AI-assisted modernization** built with community input and open collaboration.

## What is Konveyor AI?

**Konveyor AI (Kai)** provides real-time insights to help developers and migrators identify and refactor deprecated or outdated code. As a developer modernizes an application with Kai, they'll see detailed issues and their location, solutions with the reasoning for it, and code suggestions that can be automatically implemented.

Built on top of the Konveyor ecosystem, Kai brings:

- **Static code analysis**:
  Identifies potential issues when migrating to  new technologies (e.g., updating Java frameworks, containerizing an application).

- **Extensible migration paths**:
  Includes 2,400 predefined rules for different migration paths. Users can create their own custom rules for unique scenarios. 

- **VS Code extension**: 
  Suggested code changes show up within the IDE.

- **Model-agnostic AI**:  
  Users are not locked into a specific LLM, enabling flexibility in AI-driven modernization

- **Agentic AI for intelligent responses**:  
  Delivers more meaningful, sanitized suggestions, validating Maven compilations and dependency resolutions.

- **Effort estimation for dependencies**:  
  Assesses dependency updates with low, medium, or high effort levels to help plan and prioritize.

Kai can assist you with migrating from legacy Java, upgrading to Spring Boot 3, or prepping for a cloud native deployment. You can also [build custom rulesets](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp/blob/main/docs/rules.md) when needed.

## Try it out!

The 0.1.0 release is available [here](https://github.com/konveyor/editor-extensions/releases/download/v0.1.0/konveyor-v0.1.0.vsix)!

You can take Kai for a spin using [step-by-step guided scenarios](https://github.com/konveyor/kai/tree/main/docs/scenarios).
